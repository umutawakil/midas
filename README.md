# Overview
Application aggregates financial reports and real time stock market info to create aggregate statistics that can be queried upon using SQL. Its primary focus is in finding the most low risk trends across configurable time spans.

# Data Sources
Financial information has come from many sources that changes frequently from Data Vantage, to Polygon.io but at the moment it uses public federal EDGAR data. That mechanism has proveent to be the most accurate though the source files are the clunkiest they still have more accurate information than what I have seen in third party fianancial report providers.
Real time stock tinker info is coming from Polygon.io
